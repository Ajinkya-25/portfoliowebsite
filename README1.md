## Installation
 Dont know: The project description does not provide any specific installation instructions or commands to execute. You'll need to set up the environment for web development, such as installing a code editor and choosing front-end frameworks/libraries like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, or Vue.js.

   To get started with your portfolio website, follow these steps:

   1. Choose a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text) and install it on your computer.

   2. Create a new project folder for your portfolio website.

   3. Inside the project folder, create the following directories and files:
      - index.html (Main page)
      - about.html (About page)
      - projects.html (Projects page)
      - contact.html (Contact page)
      - styles.css (CSS file for styling)
      - scripts.js (JavaScript file for functionality)

   4. Add appropriate HTML structures to each of the files (index, about, projects, and contact).

   5. Style your website using CSS in the `styles.css` file.

   6. Implement the required functionality using JavaScript (or a library like React, Angular, or Vue.js) in the `scripts.js` file.

   7. Add images, descriptions, tech stacks, and links for each project in the corresponding sections of the projects page.

   8. Include your skills, goals, and any other relevant information on the about page.

   9. Fill out the email and LinkedIn details on the contact section.

   Finally, test your portfolio website to ensure it works correctly across different devices and browsers.
